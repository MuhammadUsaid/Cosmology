    <h1>Dark Energy</h1>
    <p>In physical cosmology and astronomy, dark energy is an unknown form of energy which is hypothesized to permeate all of space, tending to accelerate the expansion of the universe. Dark energy is the most accepted hypothesis to explain since the 1990s the observations indicating that the universe is expanding at an accelerating rate.</p>
