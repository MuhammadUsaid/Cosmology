    <h1>Black Hole</h1>    
    <p>A <dfn>black hole</dfn> is a region of spacetime exhibiting such strong gravitational effects that nothing—including particles and electromagnetic radiation such as <em>light</em> can escape from inside it. The theory of <em>general relativity</em> predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole.</p>

            <td><p>Objects whose gravitational fields are too strong for light to escape were first considered in the 18th century by <strong>John Michell</strong> and <strong>Pierre-Simon Laplace</strong>. The first modern solution of general relativity that would characterize a black hole was found by <strong>Karl Schwarzschild</strong> in 1916, although its interpretation as a region of space from which nothing can escape was first published by <strong>David Finkelstein</strong> in 1958. Black holes were long considered a mathematical curiosity; it was during the 1960s that theoretical work showed they were a generic prediction of general relativity. The discovery of <em>neutron stars</em> sparked interest in gravitationally collapsed compact objects as a possible astrophysical reality.</p></td>

            <td> <p>Black holes of stellar mass are expected to form when very massive stars collapse at the end of their life cycle. After a black hole has formed, it can continue to grow by absorbing mass from its surroundings. By absorbing other stars and merging with other black holes, supermassive black holes of millions of solar masses (M☉) may form. There is general consensus that supermassive black holes exist in the centers of most galaxies.</p> </td>
